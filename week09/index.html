		<h3>The Medium is the Massage.</h3>

    <p>This article gave me a new understanding of the word "media." </p>   
	<p>The medium can rebuild the world. Media can make the notion of time and space disappear. The whole idea of the press looks not essential, but it has the power to change or manipulate everything. At the same time, the media can speed up the pace of people's lives. From the railway example, we know that the media can bring information about the arrival of new things and become a warning of the modern era.</p>   
	<p>When the way of media transmission affects people's various feelings, different feelings affect the way humans see the world. Our times are continually changing. People are often unaccustomed to the emergence of new media. People will feel uncomfortable and panic when they touch the new world with old psychological conditions and senses. From Michael Faraday's example, I know that changing the ability of humans to accept and adapt will promote new things. The media drives the transmission and development of information and then encourages human thought. After that, it will change the way humans perceive society, thereby increasing the opportunities for human civilization. </p> 
	<p>The example of the alphabet in the article reminds me of my case. The article mentioned that before the invention of the alphabet, people emphasized hearing to accept things, but when people started using the alphabet, people used vision more. Before the invention of the camera, when people wanted to record one thing, they used multiple sensations together. But when cameras become popular, humans may only use vision and will not do their best to use them, because cameras have helped them remember. </p> 
	<p>This reading led me to think about the characteristics of the medium. The media has many advantages; it can promote the occurrence of new things, it can change the way of the spread of human civilization, it can also manipulate the rhythm of human life, and so on. However, it may lead to the degradation of some of the senses, affect the ability of people to think independently and lead to excessive dependence on it. </p> 
	<p>Finally, when we look at the online world today. The information it manipulates has fully integrated into human life. They are everywhere in life, and they can manipulate people's minds invisibly. </p> </h5>
