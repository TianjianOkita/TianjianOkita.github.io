			<h4> Idea</h4>
            <p> My first project was to draw an illustration based on the current situation of COVID-19.</p>
            <p>During the period when people around the world are under the quarantine, people stopped unnecessary trips, schools were closed, public transport usage drastically reduced, and factories shut down. In this short period, nature has repaired, pollution has dramatically diminished, air quality has improved, and animals have become more active.
            The epidemic is a disaster for humanity, but it has become an opportunity for environmental protection.
            </p>

			<h4> Inspiration</h4>
			
			<p>The Little Mole is an inspiration for me. People who are hiding in their homes today are like moles living in the ground. Their owners long for but are afraid of the contradictory emotions of the outside world. In my work, I will show human beings hiding in the ground and the free animals of the outside world on the same canvas from the perspective of The Little Mole. Guernica's struggling and distorted characters can also be one of my inspirations.</p>
